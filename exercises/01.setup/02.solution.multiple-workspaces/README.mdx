# Multiple workspaces

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/advanced-vitest-patterns/setup/01-02-problem/solution" />

## Defining workspaces

First, I will configure Vitest to have two workspaces.

In `vitest.config.ts`, I will define a `test.workspace` property and assign an empty array as a value to it:

```ts filename=vitest.config.ts add=4-6
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
	test: {
		workspace: [],
	},
})
```

Each entry in the `test.workspace` array will represent a standalone workspace (or project) that Vitest can run. Projects can have their own configurations, environments, and file patterns to know about the relevant test files.

For example, let's define a workspace configuration for unit tests:

```ts filename=vitest.config.ts highlight=1 add=6-14
import { defineConfig, configDefaults } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
	test: {
		workspace: [
			{
				test: {
					name: 'unit',
					environment: 'node',
					globals: true,
					include: ['**/*.test.ts'],
					exclude: [...configDefaults.exclude, '**/*.edge.test.ts'],
				},
			},
		],
	},
})
```

Here, I am declaring the following:

- The `name` of this workspace will be `'unit`';
- It will use `node` as the test `environment`;
- It will have functions like `test()` and `expect()` available globally (`globals: true`);
- It will only apply to the test files matching the `**/*.test.ts` pattern;
- And, finally, it will exclude both the default patterns in Vitest (`...configDefaults.exclude`) and the edge test cases (`**/*.edge.test.ts`).

<callout-success>You may notice that this `test` object looks really similar to the root-level `test` you can define in `vitest.config.ts`. That's because it is! Vitest allows you to define an entire test configuration nested under your workspace.</callout-success>

Similarly, I will add a workspace for edge tests:

```ts filename=vitest.config.ts add=15-22
import { defineConfig, configDefaults } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
	test: {
		workspace: [
			{
				test: {
					name: 'unit',
					environment: 'node',
					globals: true,
					include: ['**/*.test.ts'],
					exclude: [...configDefaults.exclude, '**/*.edge.test.ts'],
				},
			},
			{
				test: {
					name: 'edge',
					globals: true,
					environment: 'edge-runtime',
					include: ['**/*.edge.test.ts'],
				},
			},
		],
	},
})
```

One notable exception here is that I am using `edge-runtime` as the test environment for my edge tests. This will tap into the `edge-runtime` package we've installed earlier to give a proper test environment for our tests.

With Vitest configured, it is time to add some tests!

## Unit tests

I will head to `src/slugify.test.ts` and write a simple unit test for the `slugify()` utility function:

```ts filename=src/slugify.test.ts add=3-5
import { slugify } from './slugify'

test('returns a slugified string', () => {
	expect(slugify('hello world')).toBe('hello-world')
})
```

## Edge tests

Now, the test setup for `src/api/handler.edge.test.ts` will be slightly different.

I will start from importing the `EdgeRuntime` class from the `edge-runtime` package:

```ts filename=src/api/handler.edge.test.ts add=1
import { EdgeRuntime } from 'edge-runtime'
```

Then, let's get the request handler I need to test from `./handler`:

```ts filename=src/api/handler.edge.test.ts add=2
import { EdgeRuntime } from 'edge-runtime'
import initialCode from './handler?raw'
```

> 🦉 Notice that I am using a `?raw` import modified so that `initialCode` is a _string content of the module_ and not its exports. You will see why in a moment.

And now, I will declare the actual edge runtime that will evaluate and run my handler:

```ts filename=src/api/handler.edge.test.ts add=4-6
import { EdgeRuntime } from 'edge-runtime'
import initialCode from './handler?raw'

const runtime = new EdgeRuntime({
	initialCode,
})
```

<callout-info>While the `edge-runtime` test environment ensures that the correct global APIs are available in the test's context (like `window` or `fetch`), the `EdgeRuntime` instance creates an actual controlled runtime that will behave according to my handler (e.g. handle requests).</callout-info>

What remains is a test case where I will fetch some resource and assert that its response equals to that specified in `./handler`:

```ts filename=src/api/handler.edge.test.ts add=8-17
import { EdgeRuntime } from 'edge-runtime'
import initialCode from './handler?raw'

const runtime = new EdgeRuntime({
	initialCode,
})

test('returns the user by id', async () => {
	const response = await runtime.dispatchFetch(
		'https://example.com/users/abc-123',
	)

	await expect(response.json()).resolves.toEqual({
		id: 'abc-123',
		name: 'John Maverick',
	})
})
```

## Running tests

I can run all my tests at once using a single `vitest` command (or `npm test` already defined in the project's `scripts`):

```
npm test

 ✓  unit  src/slugify.test.ts (1 test) 1ms
 ✓  edge  src/api/handler.edge.test.ts (1 test) 3ms

 Test Files  2 passed (2)
      Tests  2 passed (2)
   Start at  11:17:31
   Duration  221ms (transform 31ms, setup 0ms, collect 30ms, tests 5ms, environment 16ms, prepare 73ms)
```

<callout-success>Notice how Vitest prints the workspace name (`unit` and `edge`) next to the respective test files. This lets you know which workspace is handling that file.</callout-success>

But I can also run individual workspaces by providing the `--project` option to the Vitest CLI and giving it the name of the workspace I want to run:

```
npm test -- --project=edge

 ✓  edge  src/api/handler.edge.test.ts (1 test) 4ms
   ✓ returns the user by id 3ms

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  1 passed (1)
   Start at  11:18:55
   Duration  224ms (transform 17ms, setup 0ms, collect 19ms, tests 4ms, environment 16ms, prepare 32ms)
```

> Providing `--project=edge` will run only those tests that match the `include` pattern of the `'edge'` workspace in `vitest.config.ts`.
