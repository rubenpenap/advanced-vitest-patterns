# Performance

Great job! :tada: The final exercise block is now behind you.

Now you are equipped with the tools and techniques to approach any performance degradation in your tests. You know how to profile tests and how to act based on that. You have a better understanding of how Vitest runs your tests and what defaults it has, as well as how opting out from those defaults might yield a huge performance improvement!

But you also know that none of those approaches are a solution to a problem. They simply change how Vitest runs your tests and you need to be mindful when introducing those changes.
