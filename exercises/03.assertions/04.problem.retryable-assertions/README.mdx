# Retryable assertions

When testing asynchronous code, your system often arrives at the expected state _eventually_. That is why you often express your intentions in tests as "wait for X to happen" instead of claiming "X must happen immediately".

In Promise-based APIs, that expectation is neatly abstracted behind the `async`/`await` keywords to keep your tests clean:

```ts nonumber
const response = await fetch('/api/songs')
await expect(response.json()).resolves.toEqual(favoriteSongs)
```

> While fetching the list of songs takes time, that eventuality is represented as a Promise that you can `await`. This guaratees that your test will not continue until the data is fetched. Quite the same applies to reading the response body stream.

But not all systems are designed like that. And even the systems that _are_ designed like that may not expose you the right Promises to await.

In those situations, you likely reach to utilities like `waitFor()` to help you express the expected eventual state of your tested code.

```ts nonumber nocopy highlight=3-5
api.sideEffect()

await vi.waitFor(() => {
	expect(api.state).toEqual(expectedState)
})
```

And this works great. But today, I'd like to show you a different approach to expressing eventual expectations.

## Your task

👨‍💼 In <InlineFile file="src/client.test.ts" />, a new challenge is waiting for you. Follow the instructions to replace `vi.waitFor()` with a new API called `expect.poll()`. Make sure your tests are passing once you're done, and see you soon!
