# Assertions

Another exercise block covered!

I hope I was successful in infecting you with my love toward assertions. You can use assertions to a great effect to elevate your test experience and make tests more useful.

Now you know how to extend the `expect()` with your custom matchers, teach Vitest to compare the uncomparable, and use built-in APIs for soft and retyable assertions.

These are exactly the things that make good tests great.

But no matter how great your tests are, they lose a lot of value if they are _slow_ 😬. Which brings me to the next exercise block... But before we continue, let's refresh and rest a bit! You want to be at your best because we are going to dissect test performance!
