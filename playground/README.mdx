# Custom matchers

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/advanced-vitest-patterns/assertions/03-01-problem" />

Imagine you're building a full-stack application. Inevitably, it fetches and processes data from the server in order to render the corresponding UI. To keep it both type- and runtime-safe, you introduce a validation library to define schemas for your data types and keep them in check.

For example, you may have a user schema:

```ts filename=src/schemas.ts highlight=3-6
import z from 'zod'

export const userSchema = z.object({
	id: z.string(),
	name: z.string(),
})

export type User = z.infer<typeof userSchema>
```

> Above, we are defining a simple `userSchema` containing fields `id` and `name`. Then we are inferring the user object's type using `z.infer` and exporting it as a `User` type for our application to use.

Then, you have a function responsible for fetching the user:

```ts filename=src/fetch-user.ts highlight=4
import type { User } from './schemas'

export async function fetchUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
	return db.user.findFirst<User>({ where: { id } })
}
```

It is clear that the `fetchUser()` function must return an object of the `User` type, which also means that it must match the `userSchema`.

How would you reflect this intention in tests?

```ts filename=src/fetch-user.test.ts
import { userSchema } from './schemas'

test('returns the user by id', async () => {
	const user = await fetchUser('abc-123')
	const result = userSchema.safeParse(user)

	expect(result.error).toBeUndefined()
	expect(result.data).toEqual({
		id: 'abc-123',
		name: 'John Maverick',
	})
})
```

> You would also need to mock the `fetchUser()`'s dependency on the `db` but I am omitting this step for brevity.

So you fetch the user with the controlled id (`await fetchUser('abc-123')`), parse it with the schema (`userSchema.safeParse(user)`), and assert that there were no errors and the parsed object matches the expected mock user.

While this testing strategy works, there are two issues with it:

1. **It's quite verbose**. Imagine employing this strategy to verify dozens of scenarios. You are paying 3 LOC for what is, conceptually, a single assertion;
1. **It's distracting**. Parsing the object and validating the parsed result are _technical details_ exclusive to the intention. It's not the intention itself. It has nothing to do with the `fetchUser()` behaviors you're testing.

Luckily, there are ways to redesign this approach to be more declartive and expressive by using a _custom matcher_.

## Your task

üë®‚Äçüíº In this exercise, your task will be to rewrite the existing test at <InlineFile file="src/fetch-user.test.ts" /> to use the matcher called `.toMatchSchema()`. The only thing is, this matcher _doesn't exist_. You have to create it!

Head to <InlineFile file="vitest.setup.ts" /> and follow the instructions to implement your custom matcher. Don't forget to include the setup file in <InlineFile file="vitest.config.ts" /> and have the tests passing once you refactor them.

Good luck!
