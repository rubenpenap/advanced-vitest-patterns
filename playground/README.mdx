# Soft assertions

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/advanced-vitest-patterns/assertions/03-05-problem" />

The software you build tends to get complex, which is a direct reflection of the
complexity behind its requirements. Sometimes, you have multiple expectations
toward your system even within a single test case (which, by the way, I find to
be absolutely normal).

For example, let's say you are testing a user subscription service. There, one of the expectations is that when the user cancels their subscription, their `user.subscription` object must transition to the correct state:

```ts highlight=3-4
user.cancelSubscription()

expect(user.subscription.state).toBe('cancelled')
expect(user.subscription.endsAt).toBe('2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z')
```

There are two criteria to assume the correct cancellation:

- The `state` property equals to `'cancelled'`;
- The `endsAt` property equals to the first day of the next month after the subscription has been cancelled.

You refelect these criteria in individual `expect()` calls (i.e. assertions).

<callout-success>You can also rely on [Implicit assertions](https://www.epicweb.dev/implicit-assertions), which are a fantastic way to express more expectations without writing additional assertions.</callout-success>

There is a great deal of value to be had from <u>**how**</u> your tests fail. In fact, most of the decisions you make when writing your tests comes down to designing a nice experience around test failures, one way or another.

So, what happens when our subscription test fails?

Right now, it can fail when either of the assertions fails (incorrect state update) or _both of them fail_ (missing state transition from `active` to `cancelled`). In any case, its failure indicates a problem and must help you get to its root cause faster.

Let's imagine this test fails because the subscription never transitioned from `active` to `cancelled`. Your first piece of feedback from the test will be this:

```txt nocopy remove=3 add=4
AssertionError: expected 'active' to be 'cancelled'

Expected: "cancelled"
Received: "active"
```

This is a useful feedback as it clearly indicates an incorrect (or missing) state transition.

**But it doesn't tell you the whole picture.**

It only tells you the result of the first failed assertion. What about the other expectations? Did they succeed or also failed? Was the `endsAt` date calculated correctly, if at all? What if you have three, five, or _ten_ assertions toward the same state? How did those fare?

All of that information is important when debugging issues. But since assertions are sensitive to order and operate on the fail-fast principle, you are locking yourself in a minigame of addressing failed assertions one-by-one instead of grasping the issue as a whole.

## Your task

Let's change that.

üë®‚Äçüíº In this one, you will refactor this user subscription test to use _soft assertions_. It's the kind of assertion that still runs and gives value but _doesn't short-circuit the test_ if it fails. Head straight to <InlineFile file="src/user.test.ts" /> and follow the instructions to refactor the test and gain more value out of its failures.

üë®‚Äçüíº Bonus points if you track down and fix the issue to have the tests passing.
