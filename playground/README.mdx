# Test isolation

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/advanced-vitest-patterns/performance/04-03-problem" />

Vitest runs every test file in a separate worker, which enables parallel execution and speeds up tests by default.

Each worker has its own isolated environment, meaning that if one test file mutates a global variable, other test files won't be affected by this mutation. This test file-level isolation is a great feature for preventing test interference.

### The Problem

While test isolation provides benefits, **it comes with a performance cost.**

When you have hundreds or thousands of test files, the overhead of spawning a worker for each file accumulates and can significantly degrade performance.

### Your Task

Follow the instructions to disable test isolation and observe the performance difference it makes in projects with a large number of test files.
