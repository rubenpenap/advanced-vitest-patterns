# Asymmetric matchers

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/advanced-vitest-patterns/assertions/03-02-problem" />

_Assymetric matcher_ is the one where the `actual` value is literal while the `expected` value is an _expression_.

```ts nonumber
//     üëá Literal string
expect('hello world').toBe(expect.stringContaining('hello'))
//                         üëÜ Expression matching many strings
```

Above, the `expect.stringContaining()` matcher is asymmetric because it doesn't describe a literal value but instead creates what is, effectively, a regular expression that can match multiple strings (`/hello/`). It describes a _logical_ equality, not _structural_.

<callout-success>Asymmetric matchers are fantastic for expectations that go beyond
literal values.</callout-success>

Here are a few more examples of asymmetric matchers for you to consider:

```ts nonumber
// Must be an object containing the "id" property that is a string.
expect(user).toEqual(expect.objectContaining({ id: expect.any(String) }))

// Must be an array with exactly two elements that are numbers.
expect(caretPosition).toEqual([expect.any(Number), expect.any(Number)])
```

<callout-warning>
	It is important to point out that in addition to asymmetric matchers all of my
	examples also include _structural comparison_: `.toBe()`, `.toEqual()`, etc.
	But instead of comparing the actual and expected values, it compares the
	actual value to the _matcher result_, which is what an asymmetric matcher
	returns.

This is what sets asymmetric matchers apart from _symmetric_ matchers that don't involve literal values, like `expect('hello').toMatch(/hello/)`.
</callout-warning>

In addition to this, asymmetric matchers are great for testing nested data structures as they allow you to describe expectations _within_ the expected literal value:

```ts nonumber highlight=3-7
expect(user).toEqual({
	id: 'abc-123',
	posts: expect.arrayContaining([
		expect.objectMatching({
			id: expect.any(String),
		}),
	]),
})
```

> Here, the `user` object is expected to literally match the object with the `id` and `posts` properties. While the expectation toward the `id` property is literal, the `posts` proprety is described as an abstract `Array<{ id: string }>` object.

## `.toMatchSchema()`

With that in mind, what kind of matcher is our custom `.toMatchSchema()`? ü§î

It does accept a Zod `schema`, which is not a literal value we want to compare anything to. But on the other hand, it embodies the whole comparison, no matter if literal or not, instead of representing a matcher result:

```ts nonumber
expect('hello').toMatch(/hello/) // symmetric
expect(user).toMatchSchema(userSchema) // also symmetric

expect('hello').toEqual(expect.stringMatching(/hello/)) // asymmetric
expect(user).toEqual(expect.toMatchSchema(userSchema)) // ???
```

Wait, can we even use it as an asymmetric matcher? Let's find out:

```ts filename=src/fetch-user.test.ts remove=6 add=7
import { fetchUser } from './fetch-user'
import { userSchema } from './schemas'

test('returns the user by id', async () => {
	const user = await fetchUser('abc-123')
	expect(user).toMatchSchema(userSchema)
	expect(user).toEqual(expect.toMatchSchema(userSchema))
})
```

```
npm test

 ‚úì src/fetch-user.test.ts (1 test) 2ms
   ‚úì returns the user by id 1ms
```

Somehow, that assertion also **passes**! üòÆ

That is happening because Vitest automatically treats custom matchers as both symmetric and asymmetric, allowing you to implement them just once and use them as you see fit.

<callout-success>The `.toMatchSchema()` matcher is _both symmetric and asymmetric_ depending on how it's being used.</callout-success>

**There is a slight problem though...** Types.

```ts
test('returns the user by id', async () => {
	const user = await fetchUser('abc-123')
	expect(user).toEqual(expect.toMatchSchema(userSchema))
	// ‚ùå                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	// Property 'toMatchSchema' does not exist on type 'ExpectStatic'.ts(2339)
})
```

At the moment of writing this exercise, Vitest does not extend the asymmetric matchers interface to let TypeScript know what type `expect.toMatchSchema()` is. But you know who will?

## Your task

üë®‚Äçüíº You! Your task right now is to modify the module augmentation in <InlineFile file="vitest.setup.ts" /> so that asymmetric matchers are recognized on the type level. Since the tests are passing as-is, you will use your IDE to verify that the custom `.toMatchSchema()` matcher has correct type definitions (use the modified <InlineFile file="src/fetch-user.test.ts" /> for that).

üë®‚Äçüíº Once the type story is solved, I want to you give the asymmetric matchers a try. In the <InlineFile file="src/fetch-transaction.test.ts" />, you will find an unfinished test case. Complete it using the asymmetric `expect.toMatchSchema()` matcher and have it passing!
